Orion User's Repository for Arch Linux

This repository includes a bunch of useful AUR packages that are not listed in other popular Arch repositories, such as linuxqq, wechat, wemeet, dingtalk, watt-toolkit(i.e. steam++), etc.

The repository builder is powered by GitHub Actions. It will automatically pull AUR packages, build them, and release to my GitHub page and Huggingface repository everyday ðŸ˜‰

If you want some nice packages in AUR, just feel free to issue ðŸ¤—

## Usage

To use this repository, add it to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

```text
[our]
Server = https://orion-zhen.github.io/our/$arch
```

Command line:

```shell
sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf << EOF
[our]
Server = https://orion-zhen.github.io/our/$arch
EOF
```

OUR repository is ready to use ðŸ˜ƒ

If you somehow cannot access to the GitHub page, you can download packages from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Orion-zhen/our) or [hf-mirror](https://hf-mirror.com/Orion-zhen/our) and then install them using `pacman -U`.

So you could:

1. search for packages in OUR using `pacman` as normal
2. download some package using `huggingface-cli` if it's in OUR
3. install the package using `pacman -U`

```shell
pacman -Ss <package-name>
huggingface-cli download Orion-zhen/our --local-dir <download-dir> --include "<package-name>-*"
sudo pacman -U <download-dir>/<package-name>-<version>.pkg.tar.zst
```

That's a very tricky way, isn't it? But I don't want to buy any expensive LFS storage space from GitHub, so let's call it a repository ðŸ˜‹
